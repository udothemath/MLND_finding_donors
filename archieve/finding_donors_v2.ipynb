    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "Run the code cell below to plot a histogram of these two features. Note the range of the values present and how they are distributed."

Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers.

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",

    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. "

    "\n",
    "Google has implemented **Gaussian Naive Bayes** to [classify spam mail][Naive Bayes]. Based on the reference, the advantage is that Naive Bayes method can be trained on a per-user basis. The customized criteria are given so that the prediction becomes more reliable according to user's specific patterns. However, if a picture or a mutated word instead of a highly possible spam word is used in a mail, the model might not be able to identify the spam properly. Since we are trying to identify whether the income is above or below 50K, which is a rather straightforward classfication problem, Naive Bayes should be a suitable method.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ensemble methods** are very powerful techniques to increase accuracy on a variety of ML tasks. It can be used in conjunction with many other types of learning algorithms to [improve their performance][ada_boost]. For instance, AdaBoost, one of the ensemblings method, is applied commonly for object detection. General speaking, every algorithm does require some parameters to be adjusted before achieving optimal performance. Ensemble methods, on the other hand, is relatively [easy to program][boosting_paper]. One potential disadvantage is that this method is sensitive to noisy data and outliers. [Here][web_boosting] provdies a nice introduction of boosting. As indicating in [Udacity supplemantary material][intro_to_boosting], we note that \"selecting an appropriate weak learner is one of the key steps towards producing a successful boosting algorithm.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm has been implemented in versatile fields, and probably computer version is one of the most common example. Handwritting or gesture recognition can be done by comparing the input with a database. Since KNN is a non-parametric method, the decision boundary can [take on any form][KNN_quora]. KNN does better when one focusses on finding the similarity between different observations, and the dataset is small. For the problem with low dimentionality, KNN should be a good choice. On the other hand, KNN might not perform well while the dimentionality is high. Furthermore, this approach cannot identify the importance of the attribute. I feel that KNN might not be a \"good\" candidate for this problem, but I would like to see how it does comparing with other \"better\" approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, **Gaussian Naive Bayes** can perform well while samples are independent to each other, and such approach doesn't require hyperparameter optimization. Due to high dimensionality of the dataset, **Gaussian Naive Bayes** and **Ensemble methods** are the good candicates for our problem. Both approaches can provide [fast][which_one] and robust results. And general speaking, **Ensemble methods** outperfroms single algorithm across a whole range of problems. \n",

    "In the code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `'clf_A'`, `'clf_B'`, and `'clf_C'`.\n",
    "  - Use a `'random_state'` for each model you use, if provided.\n",
    "  - **Note:** Use the default settings for each model — you will tune one specific model in a later section.\n",
    "- Calculate the number of records equal to 1%, 10%, and 100% of the training data.\n",
    "  - Store those values in `'samples_1'`, `'samples_10'`, and `'samples_100'` respectively.\n",

This can be supported by the accuracy score and F-score on Testing set that AdaBoostClassifier possesses the highest score throughout the training set size from 1%, 10%, and 100%. Even though the model using KNeighborsClassifier also have very similiar accuracy and F-  scores, it takes considerable amount of time for model predicting. "

    "**Answer: ** Ensemble Methods, or more explicitly AdaBoosting in our case, is chosen as the best method for this project. AdaBoosting, or Adaptive Boosting method can be considered as the combination of many different types of learning process (eg, classifier such as decision trees) to create an \"ensemble\" of predicting model whether an individual has income above 50K or not. Using features like age, sex, educational_level etc., the decision tree grows as a flowchart to answering \"yes/no\" question to classify the samples. A very important concept of AdaBoosting is that more attention is paid on weak classifier during training process. The idea is analogue to the learning process of someone, who is trying to memorize vocabulary words, will put more effort on those words he/she doesn't remember in previous exercises. By repeating this process up to desired amount of cycle, classifier improves the performance on their weakness. After each classifier is trained, the final predictive model consists of weighted classifiers where more accurate classifiers are given more weight, as an ensemble. "

    "- Import [`sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) and [`sklearn.metrics.make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html).\n",
    "- Initialize the classifier you've chosen and store it in `clf`.\n",
    " - Set a `random_state` if one is available to the same state you set before.\n",
    "- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.\n",
    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    " - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!\n",
    "- Use `make_scorer` to create an `fbeta_score` scoring object (with $\\beta = 0.5$).\n",
    "- Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using the `'scorer'`, and store it in `grid_obj`.\n",
    "- Fit the grid search object to the training data (`X_train`, `y_train`), and store it in `grid_fit`.\n",

The optimized model has outperformed the benchmark predictor and unoptimized model (Table above). Because we simply assume every income is greater than 50K in benchmark predictor, there is a large accuracy improvement from benchmark predictor to unoptimized model, as expected. The accuracy score is slightly improved from 86.67% to 87.14% by tunning learning_rate and n_estimators. However, there is presumably very limited domain knowledge introducing in these models, yet. So probably there is some room for improvement if domain knowledge is included."

    "**Answer:** Since we want to predict the income, I would rank the most important features in order as workclass, occupation, education_level, native-country, and education-num. Because the salary is closely determined by the type of job, I think workclass and occupation play a significant role here. In order to being in such occupation, education_level should be prerequisite that education-num goes above some minimal. Besides that, living standards are different at varieous countries even holding the same job, one should also consider native-country as important factor.  "

    "**Answer:** These five features are very different to my selected ones. While I take a look at the name of these features but not data itself, I feel capital-loss and capital-gain should be very important to determine the income becuase these two features are directly related to income. Then I glance on the data, I notice most of the capital-gain and capital-loss are equal to zero from first 100 datapoints. I remove these features from my prediction and I am surprised the model can still capture these capital_loss and capital_gain as the top-5 important factors. I believe age is also an important factor that young people is very unlikely to make more than 50K per year, but I am also surprised that it is so significant. Hours-per-week is a tricky feature, I would say. I feel it is hard to distinguish whether people make more money by working more. Lots of working poor do work a lot, but earn less though. However, I have to admit that I overestimate the importantance of educational_level, the necessity of more advanced education has been criticized. Because the data is collected from 1994 U.S. Census, it would be very interesting to compare with the census data which collect in 21 century."

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "**Answer:** The accuracy and F-score on full and reduced data with only five features are decreased from 0.8714 to 0.8426 and 0.7531 to 0.7007, respectively. I would argue that the prediction with reduced dataset still perform reasonably well without sacrificing too much on accuracy. Moreover, the execution time using reduced dataset is about 7.12 seconds, which is greatly less than 32.66 seconds by full dataset. Finally, one could obtain some insightful characteristics with reduced data. As what have been addressed in feature selection section, these selective features are dominated in our prediction and provide better understanding of the model. With that, I will consider using the reduced data as my training set. "
